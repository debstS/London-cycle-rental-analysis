# London-cycle-rental-analysis

This project aims to perform bike rental trends analysis using real-world Transport For London (TFL) dataset (https://cycling.data.tfl.gov.uk/). The analysis aims at extracting crucial insights, suggest business recommendations, explore different Data Science use cases, and ultimately create a simplistic model that demonstrates the application of
data science to this business.

Please find the Python notebook and SQL queries within this folder used to do the analysis.
